This is the project that we as a team are working on for The Uplift Project by GirlScript Foundation.

1.	The types of clothes available â€“ Men and Women section
2.	Shop by brands- contains products according to Brands
3.	Location of the store
4.	Contact Us section
5.	Customer friendly chat-bot for queries
6.	Blog page about the latest fashion trends

# Setup
To setup the project locally follow the instructions:

# Fork
Note: This is only needed if you want to contribute to the project.

If you want to contribute to the project you will have to create your own copy of the project on GitHub. You can do this by clicking the Fork button that can be found on the top right corner of the landing page of the repository.

# Clone
Note: For this you need to install git on your machine. You can download the git tool from https://git-scm.com/downloads

If you have forked the project, run the following command -

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME/OneClickPick.git

where YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME is your GitHub handle.

# Remote
Note: In order to contribute to the project.

When a repository is cloned, it has a default remote named origin that points to your fork on GitHub, not the original repository it was forked from. To keep track of the original repository, you should add another remote named upstream. For this project it can be done by running the following command -

git remote add upstream https://github.com/anna4j/OneClickPick.git

# Pull
In order to fetch the latest changes from the upstream or main repo, use the following command:

git pull upstream master
